<hr>
<p>Our relay full truck service is based on a global-first and unique driver relay model which allows us to deliver in unprecedented transit times while ensuring that our pilots (truck drivers) return to their homes the same day. Customers across automotive, pharmaceuticals, industrial goods, chemicals, food and beverages, media and publishing, packaging, electronics, apparel, FMCG, manufacturing and fashion have leveraged our relay full truck service to unlock value and bring efficiencies in their supply chains.</p>
<p>Relay full truck has the following distinctive features:</p>
<h5>Best transit time performance</h5>
<p>Our unique driver relay model ensures 50-70% reduction in transit times. For example, we complete Delhi – Guwahati or Delhi – Chennai trips in 3 days against the industry average of 7-8 days. These rapid transit times enable our customers to reimagine their supply chain by cutting-down inventory costs, reducing working capital, lowering storage space, preventing stock-outs, and improving speed to market.</p>
<h5>Pan India network</h5>
<p>With our extensive relay network of 70+ pit stops spread across the length and breadth of the country, we can provide FTL service from almost any location to any destination (including milk runs) and not just between Tier-I and Tier-II cities. For example, Jodhpur – Guwahati, Bangalore - Ambala, Pantnagar - Cochin or Mumbai - Kolkata.</p>
<h5>Own fleet of 250+ trucks</h5>
<p>We are one of the finest fleet owners in the country. 90% of our vehicles are less than 2 years old. We also have a mix of 22 feet and 32 feet trucks, thereby, giving us the ability to handle dense as well as voluminous cargo. Every trip is pre-inspected and our 24x7 central monitoring and tracking team ensures that the nearest pitstop and OEM dealer is alerted for immediate attention in case of any breakdown. Advanced locking mechanism with hidden locks is installed in each truck besides standard bolt system to ensure safety and security of consignments.</p>
<h5>Highest reliability and consistency in service levels</h5>
<p>Our operations are 100% technology led and data driven thereby allowing us to automate decision-making and eliminate errors. Each of our trucks is equipped with sensors for location tracking and vitals monitoring. Vehicles and pilots are auto-allocated onto trips based on availability and past performance on similar trips. Strong documentation controls have been built through automation systems.</p>
<h5>Complete transparency during operations</h5>
<p>We provide end to end visibility and tracking to our customers. Indent placement and acceptance, placement assurance, real-time minute by minute vehicle tracking on map, automated vehicle arrival alerts before loading and unloading, delay alerts due to unforeseen events, advanced GPS logs from start to end of the trip, data reports and MIS dashboard are all made available to customers through desktop and mobile based applications.</p>
<h5>Customized solutions</h5>
<p class="mb-5">We spend time understanding specific requirements of our customers and innovate to provide breakthrough solutions. One such product we have built is LPCD (linear programming based continuous dispatch) service for automotive clients where we leveraged our technology and data science teams to build an algorithm that optimizes multi-modal dispatches (couriers, FTLs etc.) into a single continuous dispatch service, which is charged at a geography-based flat rate. Our LPCD service has brought down damages to under 0.1% of shipment value, and at 50% lower TAT compared to typical surface courier services with zero instances of shipment reconciliation errors and missing box claims by consignees.</p>
